# My portfolio website
This site was created as part of the first assignment in my new education to test our skills in front-end development.
It is written with Vue, scss and compiled with Laravel-mix which is a simple to use webpack package.

## Cloning
If you want to use this Repository as a template for your own portfolio do so by clicking the clone button
### Setup
after cloning the repository cd into it and run ``npm install``
to compile the scss and js/vue run ``npm run production`` for production or ``npm run dev``

Have fun with your portfolio!
